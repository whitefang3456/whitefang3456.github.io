# Days after Mobius Ended
Date: 23-06-2020 

Everyone doing well after Mobius ended? I just want to report how am I doing especially these periods of pandemic.

### Beginning of April

As promised to myself, I have uninstalled all the gacha games from every platform i could ever installed. Not because of rage, but i did those willingly this time. Likely because of end of the loop mobius to me, not sure whether it reaches many people. But i have lost the urge of gamble with fate (or rather called rngesus a.k.a RNG Jesus if He exists). Maybe it's time for me to get back into Reality. 

I resumed my work as freelance programmer, researching forums about IT technologies as I used to. The passion of thriving, still lies within me, just like "The Light of Hope". And in same time, the goverment in my country Malaysia is ongoing lockdown mode, so I have more time to work from home. I managed to learn couple cooking dishes (not to say I'm very good as home cook, but they're edible and looks good ww). Japanese-styled Fried Rice (Nihon Cha-han), stir-fried vegetables, omelettes, and baking breads, so i can pretty keep myself survivable in case i'm all alone (Not expect to have my future wife to do all the works right, that's if i have one (sob)). And oh, I adopted a kitten, and her name is Allur, which i asked opinions from friends in twitter ww.

### Ending of April, Beginning of May

Another month has passed, things getting back little bit unfamiliar to me. Not actually bad thing, but it's new norm as expected. The country has stricted the lockdown rules, that only allow us to purchase grocery items by 1 representative of family. The roads were less filled with vehicles, even traces of people around my area. Been working together with parents about identifying and purchasing goods including new cat feeds for Allur and elder Mao cat that we have adopted since Feb, so they can spend some time in cooking, baking new stuffs with our microoven, like butter marble cakes, chocolate cakes and so on. And i managed to reconcile with my Mother, told her that Mobius dillema is finally ended as i didn't let her know about End-Of-Service notice since January, that was really like eternal trials for me to keep worries away from her, as we had debates for that almost 2 years. It's finally time for us to have normal family time like we used to. I'm grateful of Mobius end-loop and this lockdown period, we had lots of things thought in our mind, and those changes our perspective of living.

### Beginning of June

So 2 months after Mobius ended? Time sure flies, i feel like an old man (in fact i'm not young as i used to ww). Been working like hell from home, for sake of living and online item purchases such as mechanical keyboards for my daily uses (Don't worry, i can control my urge of buying unnecessary items ww). Every morning, evening walk outside my yard with Allur as our entertainer (she's really adorable), watching her growth for almost three months, like instant Pokemon evolution ww. Sometimes i revisited the "Memorial of Honor" site to see list of our comrades who fought along together, and rewatching old videos of me fighting as Wol in Palamecia. I'm glad i managed to achieve those with what i had.

I kindly wish everyone doing their best in life, and live for those who're no longer in this real world.

MEBIUS LOVE,
WFang
